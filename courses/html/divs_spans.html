<!-- 
    remember that for this you realy need to utilize with CSS. Basically, 
    we're going to be using div and span tags to actually group together blocks of HTML.
    And the reason we want to group them together usually is to apply  CSS to them
-->
    <h1>Divs and Spans</h1>

<!--
    You want to do it by a specific division or a group of elements that you define. And the way 
    you can do that, as we'll see later on in the CSS section, is by actually calling a div tag.

    And so the way it would work is you can see here I have div and if I hit enter notice that we 
    automatically get this class to pop out here and that's going to allow us to essentially name 
    this division after a class. 
    
    And then we can apply styles to that class and we can put whatever we want in that class. So for 
    instance, I can now put this all here, give this class a name such as something like Group one, 
    save this.

    And if I refresh this, we won't notice anything different here in the HTML later on. When we learn
    about CSS, we'll learn how to actually add style to a division with a class name instead of just 
    actual element tags.
    
    And that's basically what we're going to be using a division for. So right now, this div tag by 
    itself in HTML doesn't mean a whole lot. It's going to mean a lot more when we learn about CSS.
    
    It's used in combination with CSS. -->

    <div class="groupeone">
        <h1>Group one</h1>
        <p>I want to be togethre in group one</p>
    </div>

<!-- 
    the span tag. 
    And basically the span tag is almost the exact same thing as a division, except it's inline instead 
    of grabbing an entire container.

    So let's say we have this class or this div division of group one.
    If I wanted to make essentially a little inline container to only apply effects to an inline section,
    so only apply effects for instance, to these three letters or three words here, be together and in
    what I could do is wrap them in a span tag and then put whatever I want there to be in that span.

    We don't notice any difference because we haven't actually applied any style to it.
    But just keep these two key words in mind for tagging when we later learn about CSS. -->
  
    
    <div class="groupeone">
        <h1>Group one</h1>
        <p>I want to <span>be togethre in</span> group one</p>
    </div>
